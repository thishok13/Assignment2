                        <p>Giraffes, with their high legs and lengthy necks, are the world's tallest mammals. A giraffe's legs alone are roughly 6 feet long, making it taller than many humans. Giraffes can run as fast as 35 miles per hour over short distances and cruise at 10 miles per hour over extended distances thanks to their enormous legs.</p>

                        <p>The world's largest bird is the flightless ostrich. They live in African savannas and deserts, and the plants they eat provide them with the majority of their water.</p>

                        <p>Tigers are the largest cats in the world, and they are known for their power and strength. Bengal tigers are sometimes known as Indian tigers because they inhabit in India. They are the most common tiger species, accounting for over half of all wild tigers.</p>

                        <p>Leopards, like lions, tigers, and jaguars, are sleek and strong big cats. Many of their populations, particularly outside of Africa, are threatened. Because the leopard is so muscular and at ease in trees, it frequently drags its prey into the branches.</p>

                        <p>Lemurs are primates that can only be found on the African island of Madagascar and a few nearby islands. The long, brilliantly striped black-and-white tail of ring-tailed lemurs makes them easily identifiable. Many zoos have them as permanent inhabitants.</p>

                        <p>It can be found in open terrain from India to Taiwan and Java. Because it generally lives in farmlands where human contact and rodent prey are plentiful, it is a leading cause of snakebite mortality within its range.

                        <p>Burmese pythons are perhaps best recognized as the snake of choice among reptile owners for big reptiles, thanks to its gorgeously patterned skin, quick development rate, and typically gentle nature.

Whitish, creamy-beige, buff, tan, rust, reddish-maroon, brown, a dark seal brown, or black are some of the colors that can be used.  The underparts and front legs are often cream-colored, but the head might be brown or beige with a prominent white spot between the ears.  Colors vary depending on the subspecies.</p>
