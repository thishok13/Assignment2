                    SCIENTIFIC NAME: Panthera leo<br>
                    TYPE: Mammals<br>
                    DIET: Carnivore<br>
                    GROUP NAME: Pride<br>
                    SIZE: Head and body, 4.5 to 6.5 feet; tail, 26.25 to 39.5 inches<br>

                </p>
                <p>Throughout history, African lions have been revered as emblems of bravery and strength. These legendary cats have muscular bodies—they're only second in size to tigers in the cat family—and roars that can be heard from five kilometers distant. The coat of an adult lion is yellow-gold, whereas that of a juvenile lion has some light patches that fade with age. The stunning fringe of long hair that encircles the heads of only male lions is known as a mane.</p>

                    <p>African lions previously roamed the majority of Africa, as well as areas of Asia and Europe. However, the species has vanished from 94 percent of its ancient range and is now only found in sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from tropical rainforests and deserts, these lions prefer grasslands, scrub, or open woodlands where they can more easily hunt their prey, but they can exist in most ecosystems.</p>

                    <p>Though there is one population of solitary lions, lions are the only cats that live in groups called prides. Prides are family groups of lions that can range in size from two to forty, with up to three or four males, a dozen or more females, and their offspring. The lionesses in a pride are all connected, and female cubs often stay with the group as they grow older. Young males eventually leave and form their own prides by taking over another male-led group.</p>
