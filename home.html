                <h2>About the zoo</h2>
                <p>The National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka (also known as Colombo Zoo or Dehiwala Zoo) was established in 1936 at Dehiwala, Sri Lanka. Its vast expanses are home to a wide range of animals and birds. The zoo not only showcases animals, but it also focuses on animal conservation, welfare, and education. 
                    Dehiwala Zoo now holds 72 mammal species, 65 bird species, 31 reptile species, 89 fish species, three amphibian families, and 30 butterfly species, among others. Due to breeding and free-living bird colonies, the total number of animals ranges from 2500 to 3000. Dehiwala Zoo is well-known among visitors not only for its variety of indigenous and exotic species, but also for its beautiful greenery landscaping. Through good animal welfare, the Zoo supports and promotes conservation by reproducing rare and endangered species.
                    The Zoo attracts over 1.5 million local and international visitors each year. In addition, the Zoo attracts around 2000 students and groups of students from schools and universities for educational and demonstrative purposes.
